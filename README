About this Package
------------------
The purpose of this package is to provide a CIM Client Class Library
for Java applications. It complies to the DMTF standard CIM Operations over
HTTP and with JCP JSR48. A RFC 2614 compliant SLP package is included for WBEM
service discovery.

To learn more about DMTF visit http://www.dmtf.org.
More info about the Java Community Process and JSR48 can be found at
http://www.jcp.org and http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=48.

To learn more about the SBLIM CIM Client for Java download and extract the 
documentation archive. You'll find a lot of useful information on the javadoc
overview page.

Requirements
------------
In order to build, install and operate this package you will need a 
Java SDK or Run Time Environment of version 1.5 or higher, depending on
whether you build binaries from sources or use the pre-built binaries (JAR
file).

As a requirement for building the SBLIM CIM Client, Apache Ant 
(http://ant.apache.org) needs to be setup properly. We would like to recommend
a Apache Ant version 1.6.5 or higher. (Lower versions might also work properly
here)


Building and Installing the CIM Client
--------------------------------------
The build process is based on Apache Ant, so it is very easy to build the 
SBLIM CIM Client.

Running Sun Java SDK:
If you have a xerces parser included into your systems CLASSPATH environment 
variable, no further dependencies need to be resolved.
If you don't have a xerces parser included, please create a directory named 
'lib' in the 'basedir' directory of the SBLIM CIM Client. Please copy the 
'xerces' Java Archives (JAR files) into this 'lib' directory.

An Ant build.xml file is in place which supports the following targets:
  
ant clean         - Cleans up the directory structure
ant build_core    - Builds the SBLIM CIM Client core classes
ant build_utst    - Builds the SBLIM CIM Client unit tests
ant build_smpl    - Builds the SBLIM CIM Client samples
ant package       - Builds the JAR files
ant java-doc      - Composes the JavaDoc for the SBLIM CIM Client
ant release       - Builds release TAR balls and Zip archives
ant unittest      - Executes the unit tests
ant all           - Build release archives and executes the unit tests
ant cvs-update    - Performs a 'cvs update -AdP' on the project
ant help          - Displays a help message

The execution of the build process is very easy. Once, Apache Ant is setup 
properly on your system, just execute 'ant <target>' in the 'basedir' directory
of the SBLIM CIM Client. The output will be written into a new created
directory named 'build'. That's all.


Using the SBLIM CIM Client
--------------------------
The SBLIM CIM Client is a Java implementation that can be used in all 
applications which deal with CIMOMs.
It is packaged into a Java Archive (JAR file) that can be consumed by other
Java applications as needed.

sblim-cim-client2.jar:	This jar contains the core client with the SBLIM API

Additionally, the SBLIM CIM Client is also packaged as RPM package which can be
used in Linux Distributions to be installed. The RPM is based on the 
infrastructure that is defined by the JPackage project.
