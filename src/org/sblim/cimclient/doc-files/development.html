<h1>SBLIM CIM Client for Java Development Guidelines</h1>

<h2>Contact</h2>
If you have any questions about the SBLIM CIM Client for Java you may contact the development team lead at 
<a href="mailto:blaschke@us.ibm.com">blaschke@us.ibm.com</a>.
<h2>Releases</h2>
<p>Planned releases appear in the middle of the last month of every quarter (middle of March, June, September and December). 
It might occur that we publish a release out of schedule on request of one of our exploiters as well.<br />
A release is a code level that has been intensively tested and is supported. Releases are the
only origins for maintenance branches.</p>
<h2>CVS</h2>
<p>The sources can be found at "sblim.cvs.sourceforge.net/cvsroot/sblim/jsr48-client". Refer to SourceForge
regarding CVS access rules and permissions.</p>
<p>All patches are committed to the "Experimental" branch first. The code in this branch is the most 
active, but it hasn't undergone a community review and is therefore unapproved.<br />
Once a patch has been approved in the community review it will be merged into the "HEAD" branch. When 
a new release is published it represents the content of the "HEAD" branch at the release date. Of course,
all releases have a corresponding version tag in CVS.</p>
<h2>Bug Tickets</h2>
The Bug Ticket process step are as follows
<ol>
	<li>Somebody (a.k.a. the bug owner) files a bug in Bug Tickets.</li>
	<li>A developer reads the problem description and assigns the bug.</li>
	<li>A developer either accepts the bug (Status-&gt;open-accepted)<ul><li>Proceed with step 4</li></ul>
	requests additional information (Status-&gt;open-needinfo)<ul><li>Await new information, repeat step 3</li></ul> 
	or denies it (Status-&gt;pending-duplicate, pending-invalid, pending-rejected, pending-wont-fix or pending-works-for-me).<ul><li>A reasonable justification will be posted 
	to the comments. Once the bug owner agrees we proceed with step 8.</li></ul></li>
	<li>A developer creates a patch. The patch will be attached to Bug Ticket and committed into the 
	Experimental branch (Status-&gt;open-fixed).</li>
	<li>The community review is initiated. A corresponding comment is added to Bug Ticket.</li>
	<li>The community review is completed and successful. A corresponding comment is added to Bug Ticket
	and the patch is merged into the HEAD branch. The bug Status is changed to pending-fixed. If the community review
	was unsuccessful we go back to step 4.</li>
	<li>The patch is picked up by the next release. A corresponding comment is added to Bug Ticket.</li>
	<li>The bug is closed (Status-&gt;closed-*).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Patches</h2>
Patches are created relative to the latest release. We usually use the "create patch" action
from Eclipse.	
<h2>Code Conventions</h2>
<h3>File Encoding</h3>
<p>The workspace default encoding should be set to "UTF-8" on all platforms. For *.properties-files
we keep the Eclipse default of "ISO-8859-1".</p>
<h3>File Headers</h3>
<p>Each source file contains a file header stating copyright, authorship and change history. For 
Java sources the header looks like this:</p>
<span style="font-family:courier"><pre>

<p>Insert your name and IBM email after the "@author" tag and replace "Date" and "Prog" with
todays date and your CVS account name. We use bug 1565892 for the initial development of the
JSR48 client.</p>
<h3>Formatting</h3>
<p>The code is formatted using the Eclipse code formatter. Use 
the formatter settings stored in the "EclipseJavaCodeFormatter.xml". All code should be 
formatted before committing to CVS.</p>
<h3>Naming Conventions</h3>
<p>We use the following naming conventions in our code (not all sources have been migrated to these 
conventions  yet):</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5%">
	<tr align="left">
		<th>entity</th>
		<th>naming</th>
		<th>sample</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>class, interface</td>
		<td>mixed-case, first letter uppercase</td>
		<td>class <i>HttpClient</i></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>method</td>
		<td>mixed-case, first letter lowercase</td>
		<td>HttpClient <i>getClient()</i></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>parameter</td>
		<td>mixed-case, prefix 'p'</td>
		<td>void setClient(HttpClient <i>pClient</i>)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>local variable</td>
		<td>mixed-case, first letter lowercase</td>
		<td>int <i>loopCounter</i></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>field</td>
		<td>mixed-case, prefix 'i'</td>
		<td>String <i>iName</i></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>static field</td>
		<td>mixed-case, prefix 'c'</td>
		<td>static String <i>cName</i></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>static final field</td>
		<td>uppercase</td>
		<td>static final String <i>NAME</i> = "SBLIM"</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>Access to members is not qualified with "this." the prefixing usually does a good job avoiding 
hidden members. </p>
<h3>Javadoc</h3>
<p>Javadoc is mandatory for all public APIs of a class. This includes the class comment, methods comments 
and public member comments. It's mandatory as well for packages. See existing "package.html" files as
example for package level javadoc.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<p><em>We aim at warning-free code.</em> The project settings in CVS include a high warning level,
do not mangle with them. All warnings have to be resolved, including unused imports or missing javadoc
before any code is committed. There are a few warnings that can be ignored for good reason, e.g. a
precautionary throws declaration where the declared exception is not actually thrown by the current
implementation. But the cases are rare.</p>
<p>All code is REQUIRED to compile on IBM/SUN Java 1.5.x/1.6.x/1.7.x. 
Therefore Java 1.6 and 1.7 constructs are not allowed.</p>
<p>Use of default or protected visibility is discouraged. Fields should be private, provide getters 
and setters for public or subclass access. External and internal classes/interfaces should be clearly
separated by using "*.internal" packages.</p>
<p>The <em>public</em> content 
of the javax.* classes is defined by JSR48. It is prohibited by license terms to add, change or omit any
visible (public or protected) entities (classes, interfaces, fields, methods, parameters).</p>
